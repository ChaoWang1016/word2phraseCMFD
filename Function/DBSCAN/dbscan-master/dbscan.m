%DBSCAN Given a (usually sparse) similarity matrix, cluster the items
%   Aim:
%       Clustering the data with Density-Based Scan Algorithm with Noise (DBSCAN)
%
%   Input:
%       A - similarity matrix (should be sparse, this is quite slow if it
%       isn't sparse!)
%       Eps - Neighbourhood radius, things are considered neighbours if
%       their similarity is HIGHER than this value
%       minPts - number of objects in a neighborhood of an object (minimal
%       to consider the object to be in a cluster)
% e.g.
% x=[randn(30,2)*.4;randn(40,2)*.5+ones(40,1)*[4 4]];
% dbscan(simdist(x), 0.5, 10)
% == 2 cluster
% also tested with quite challenging setups:
% A = sprand(50000,50000,0.01);
% A = triu(A) + triu(A,1)'; %make it diagonal, more realistic
% clusters = dbscan(A,0.1,5); %takes about 10 seconds

    nrows = size(A,1);
    
    visited = zeros(nrows,1); % visited
    noise = zeros(nrows,1); % noise
    clusters = zeros(nrows,1); % the clusters

    clusterIndex = 1;

    for i = 1:nrows
        if visited(i) == 1
            continue
        end
        % get the unvisited items with a valid similarity
        region = A(:,i) > Eps & ~visited;
        % make sure we have enough neighbours
        % we leave the item "unvisited", it could become part of another
        % cluster
        if nnz(region) < minPts
            noise(i) = 1 ;% add to noise
        else
            % unassigned, assign to the current cluster index
            clusters(i) = clusterIndex;
            
            % while we have non-zero elements
            while nnz(region) > 0
                % get the index of the first non-zero element
                ip = find(region,1);
                % remove it from the region, declare assignment
                region(ip) = 0;
                visited(ip) = 1;
                % get unvisited neighbours with a valid similarity
                regprime = A(:,ip) > Eps & ~visited ;
                % add those items to the region if there are enough
                if nnz(regprime) >= minPts
                    region = regprime | region;
                end
                % assign to the current cluster, remove from noise
                noise(ip) = 0;
                clusters(ip) = clusterIndex;
            end
            clusterIndex = clusterIndex + 1;
